## Tags

Several models in InvenTree can be tagged with arbitrary tags. Tags are useful for grouping items together. This can be used to mark items with a plugin or to group items together for a particular theme. Tags are meant to be used by programms and are not visible to the end user.
Tags are shared between all models that can be tagged.

The following models can be tagged:
- [Parts](../../part/part.md) and [Supplier Parts](../../order/company#supplier-parts)/[Manufacturer Part](../../order/company#manufacturer-parts)
- [Stock Items](../../stock/stock.md#stock-item) / [Stock Location](../../stock/stock.md#stock-location)
